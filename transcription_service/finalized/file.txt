186725119354339328 -  myself credit for programming. I'm going to say like a head programmer, Kaden, head production kid and head of music kid.

249401853693919234 -  Hehe.

186725119354339328 -  I'm gonna say like a head programmer, Kaden, head production kid and head of music kid.

245048363932712961 -  Yes.

186725119354339328 -  What was Caden? Although when they ended, they were, and the others were the good job. Don't be wrong. They did fine.

245048363932712961 -  Thank you.

245048363932712961 -  Where house are we? Is there a guy?

186725119354339328 -  Uh, well, okay. So what happened is I got, I have able to live from a student that's kind of all that kind of stuff. I, I talked to two my co-workers who told me about how to make that sound. It's called a sauce. It's called a sauce synth in a swoop. And then I'm gonna, I'm gonna try to record it. But for right now, I just need to get a playable prototype of the game together because for some fucking reason, the other, the brain damage programmer guy is never free until 830 p.m. So I was like, I used to use these, we used something. Like, we just need something. Yeah?

186725119354339328 -  I'm going to try to record it, but for right now, I just need to get a playable prototype of the game together because for some fucking reason the other the brain damage programer guy is never free until 830 pm so I was like I used to use these we used to something like we just need something yeah.

249401853693919234 -  .

249401853693919234 -  Thank you.

249401853693919234 -  You

245048363932712961 - Wait!

249401853693919234 - 

245048363932712961 -  Is he like, is he in?

249401853693919234 - 

249401853693919234 -  And by aeroregleich I wanted to do this. And by tryin' to do another easy giver in a matter of time of an hour and a half of a double bond. But what is that just for our relationship of the peoples that are still and socializing hospitals? Since I grew up with this curled call,

245048363932712961 -  Like I said, he's in the programming version of game design.

249401853693919234 - 

186725119354339328 -  No, no, no, no, we don't get any of those people. They split us off. The programming people in gamers, I'm actually, I wouldn't have to do this with, they split our thing off. So only people who program in my class anymore, are people in the Arab Games and play a medium major, that just happened in the programming a bit more than usual. And then very rarely, when you find people like me, who actually went through the effort of switching and are actually can say their programmers. So that's the problem. I'm dealing with people that wants to program, I want to learn on a program and can kind of can program. But like this guy who just sits there staring at us, has no lateral, like no, like test.

249401853693919234 - 

249401853693919234 -  you

249401853693919234 -  Yeah.

249401853693919234 -  Yeah.

249401853693919234 - 

249401853693919234 -  Thank you.

249401853693919234 -  There you go

249401853693919234 -  Thank you.

186725119354339328 -  agency like I was just you know like I was doing with you on under like I was just plugging shit in for like 20 minutes and then eventually work to now have it Fully working. It's like he just doesn't do that at all or he's lying But he seems a nice guy, so I don't think he's lying

249401853693919234 -  Yeah.

249401853693919234 -  My school does that to this for us off.

186725119354339328 -  Thank you.

186725119354339328 -  No, you, so what, sorry, Logan, the first specification date, they split us off. It's two different degrees, but what you just happened every year, but not now and going forward, is for this class to compute the science, compsai, and the art people would collaborate and be in groups together. So you wouldn't have this problem, like I've been having work. My last group had no programmers, so I did all of the programming, which is a nightmare. And now this group I have two programmers, but they have no clue what to do. And like,

249401853693919234 -  Thank you.

249401853693919234 - 

245048363932712961 -  you

249401853693919234 -  Mm-hmm.

245048363932712961 - 

245048363932712961 -  and it's my fault, but that's fun.

245048363932712961 -  HW.

249401853693919234 -  We take you to the churches

245048363932712961 -  Thank you for your support. Thank you for your support.

245048363932712961 -  But the networks would have been the view when disciples came up.

249401853693919234 -  It's just not gonna sign. And here he's gonna sign bad ones.

186725119354339328 -  What do you mean?

245048363932712961 -  Thank you.

249401853693919234 -  Because I think
